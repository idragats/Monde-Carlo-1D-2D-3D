# Monde Carlo 

This code has been created to describe Monte Carlo method, the Monte Carlo method is an iterative process based on a random selection of numbers. 
In this section we select a random number between 0, and 1, and with a probability of P=0.5, a technique which is widely known as random walk. 
We apply this method in 1 dimension using six different times  (N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000). 
Every time we calculate the average of N random numbers, and we alse write the data file for the different values of N and as a result. 
Finally we create the total graph, where the x axis includes N values at the log scale and y axis includes averages of the random numbers. 
Finally we can see that as the value of N increases, the accuracy of the average tends to be equal to the initial probability of 0.5.
